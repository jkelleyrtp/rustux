# Introduction to Rustux
## Chapter 1


<!-- Rustux aims to be a fairly opinionated state management system for Rust-based web applications. This gives the advantage of multithreaded and type safe code that abstracts web-specific chunks in a way that feels native to rust. 

Certain abstractions have been made to make cookies, multithreading, and local storage all feel like any other Rust code you might write. We are able to reduce the amount of boiler plate needed by leveraging the internal state management system. For example, cookies are treated like native rust structs in a default store - interacting with them is as simple as using typical rust handling with error states that make sense for your code. -->
